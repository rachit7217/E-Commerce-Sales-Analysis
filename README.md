Creating a Power BI project for "E-commerce Sales Analysis" involves several key features that utilize Excel, SQL, and Power BI tools effectively:

1. **Data Collection**: Use SQL to extract relevant sales data from databases, including customer information, product details, sales transactions, and returns.

2. **Data Preparation**: Import the data into Excel for initial cleaning and transformation. This may include handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing formats.

3. **Data Modeling**: Establish relationships between different datasets in Power BI. Create a data model that connects sales data with product and customer data, enabling comprehensive analysis.

4. **Metrics and KPIs**: Define key performance indicators (KPIs) such as total sales, average order value, conversion rates, and customer retention rates. Use DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI to calculate these metrics.

5. **Visualizations**: Design interactive dashboards using various visual elements such as bar charts, line graphs, pie charts, and tables. Visualize trends in sales over time, product performance, and customer demographics.

6. **Filtering and Slicing**: Implement filters and slicers in Power BI to allow users to view data by different dimensions, such as time periods, product categories, and customer segments.

7. **Insights and Recommendations**: Analyze the visualized data to generate actionable insights, such as identifying best-selling products, peak sales periods, and customer behavior patterns.

8. **Sharing and Collaboration**: Publish the Power BI dashboard to the Power BI service for sharing with stakeholders and facilitating collaborative decision-making.

By integrating these features, the "E-commerce Sales Analysis" dashboard can provide valuable insights to drive business strategies.
